LABKEY Admin:  To setup your ICEMR assay you need to do the following:

1) Create new project
2) Pick the ICEMR project type and pick your settings
3) After completing project creation you should see the Assay List, Sample Sets, and Add Diagnostics web parts
4) Create a new Assay Design
5) Pick the "ICEMR Adaptation" type
6) Name it "Adaptation Assay" and save
7) Create a new Assay Design
8) Pick the "ICEMR Diagnostics" type
9) Name it "Diagnostics Assay".  Note that this assay design must be named "Diagnostics Assay"
10) Import a Sample Set
11) Name it "Flasks".  Note this name must be "Flasks"
11) in "Sample Set Data" just paste in "SampleID" for the first row and "1" for the second
12) under "Id Columns" pick "SampleID" for #1 and then save the sample set
13) Since we pasted in a row of data, remove it.  Check the first row in the Sample Set Contents and delete.
14) Now click "Edit Fields" in the Sample Set Properties (of Sample Set Flasks)
15) Select "Import Fields"
16) paste the contents of <LABKEY_ROOT>/server/customModules/ICEMR/resources/samples/flaskFields.txt into dialog
17) Save - at this point you should have the correct metadata for the flask samples.

Verify your setup
1) Go back to your ICEMR Project Folder
2) click the "Upload data" link in the Add Diagnostics webpart
3) You should see a form entitled "Data Import" with all the diagnostic fields in it
4) Go back to your ICEMR Project Folder
5) click "Adaptation Assay" in the Assay List
6) click "Import Data" you should see a "Data Import Form" with the Flask Properties and Flask fields in it.
